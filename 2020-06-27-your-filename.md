## $k-$NN Algorithms

Any $k-$NN algorithm can be characterize by the way it complete the next three processes: 

- Definition of a neighborhood $N_{k}(x)$ for every point $x \in X$.
- Computing of the average behavior inside this neighborhood by means of a certain function $f$ over $N_{k}(x)$.
- Comparisson of the $f$ values.

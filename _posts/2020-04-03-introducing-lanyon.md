In this post I am going to introduce you to TDA and how to use it as an anomaly detection tool.

## Main Problem

$k-$Nearest Neighbor algorithms ($k-$NN) are widely used for anomaly detection regardless their high sensibility to changes in scale parameter $k$. This shortcoming, here named 
Local-Global Duality, occurs independently to the way nearest neighbors are selected. Topological description of data sets by persistent homology leads to a new model for 
anomaly detection where the multi scale nature of the topological featuring brought by homology persistence solves Local-Global Duality for single anomalies. The proposed 
anomaly detection model leans on the comparison between noteworthy topological changes inducted by single point extractions and the relative topological variation inherent 
to the data set. The relevant changes are measured using the Bottleneck Distance to compare persistent diagrams associated to deformations in data when a single point is 
removed. The proposed model and some $k-$NN algorithms  are compared in some experiments.

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **â˜°** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
